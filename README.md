# sqliteDemo
A simple Asp.Net website using a sqlite database.

This is a simple CRUD form that writes to a sqlite database. In searching for examples of using sqlite with Asp.net, a lot of examples turned out to actually be for .Net windows programs, or were fairly dated. It just doesn't get much easier than working with a simple Asp.Net website. Just set it up to run in IIS or open it in Visual Studio using "Open Website" and view it in a browser. 

The only thing you should have to configure to get it working is to change the path to the db in your web.config file.

This demo uses some code from various places around the web for presentation. Credit for any code used is commented in the code.

Outside of that, this is a working demo that basically consists of the db file, one Web Form, and the web.config file. It doesn't get much simpler than this.
